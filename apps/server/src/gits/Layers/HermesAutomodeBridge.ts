 * must clear its not-before time plus the slot scheduler, arming, capacity, policy gates,
 * and kill switch before the driver runs it.
 *
 * Re-approving a proposal whose episode already has a live goal is a no-op, so a double
 * click (or a retry after a flaky RPC) cannot queue the same work twice.
 *
 * Bridge failures are logged, not surfaced — see the note on the decide bridge: the edits
 * and decision already persisted, and failing the RPC afterwards would strand the operator.
